# CSC-281: Introduction to Computer Science II

## Overview
This repository is an archive of work conducted as part of American University's second introductory level computer science course. While most of the project code contained here is representative of my own original thinking, it does feature work that was the result of collaboration with other students. I may revisit or revise this code in the future.

## File Structure
Files are sorted by assignment.

Each project includes:

1. All source files, properly named and packaged
2. Compiled code representative of the latest working version

Project files follow standard Java naming conventions. Some later assignments have been sorted into src and bin folders, in following with the standard file arrangement in Eclipse.

## Language
All projects were written using Java Version 1.8.0_121.
