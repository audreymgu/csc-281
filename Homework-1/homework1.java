/**
 * Homework 1 for CSC-281.001 Spring 2017
 * 
 * Your codename: Shurdriira
 * 
 * This assignment consists of 7 problems. Problem 1 asks you to modify existing
 * code for three subproblems.The remaining six problems each require you to 
 * write a method that satisfies the requirements stated in their descriptions.
 * 
 * You are required to create a javadoc style comment for each method you
 * create. See the sample method named add3 for an example to follow. 
 * 
 * Your homework will be graded in the following manner:
 * 70 points for correctness.
 * 		10 points per problem.
 * 		Does your input match the expected output exactly?
 * 30 points for following standards. Evaluation considerations for these points:
 *		Did you use vi to craft your code?
 *		Are camel case and Pascal case used correctly?
 * 		Did you follow the the submission instructions properly?
